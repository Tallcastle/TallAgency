	-Expanded Intelligence Service-

these changes where initially crafted as part of a larger (and far more ambitious) mod.
After loosing hundreds of hours of work due to nonsense with paradox updates corrupting my work in the past, I've elected to make a variety of smaller “bite-sized” mods broken down by theme.

This should help with testing for balance and bugs, and will make these available to those interested in them without the need to tolerate other adjustments subscribers don't want in their game.

These mods are to be provided for free, if you paid for it YOU HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!

Anyone can use them in their own mod if you like, you don't need my permission to do so.

If you DO use any of my work, I only ask for 2 things.

1. Credit me in your mod.
2. Friend Request, then Message me via Steam chat to let me know, I would love to see your work.
